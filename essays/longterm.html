        <h1>Long-term thinking</h1>
        <h2>7 Feb, 2025</h2>


        <p>In today’s fast world marked by instant gratification, ask someone what they perceive by long term thinking.
            Ask someone what long-term thinking means to them, and their answer often stops at the next job, the next
            trip,
            or the next big purchase. People have a broad vision for their life 10 years ahead, but their timelines are
            often unrealistic. We overfit and abuse the linear model of life and crave for instant rush and spike in
            dopamine,
            which all too soon adjust to the new baseline leaving the same ache as earlier. Maybe even more intense and
            insatiable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The way I define long term thinking is making choices consistently to achieve whatever goals you have -
            an impactful career, wealth, great research or good health. Why think long term? Because life is a
            cumulative.
            Skills, decisions - poor or good accrue, which are key to mastery. Long term shouldn’t breed complacency and
            a
            mindset that “I have enough time”. Instead, to determine what you actually like doing and do it for the
            longest
            time achieving impact, personal satisfaction and mastery in that field.
        </p>

            To internalize: why long-term is hard. Even though several prominent and successful people in sports,
            business and art have spoken about how they put in several years into their craft before seeing explosive
            returns, it doesn’t seem relatable. The J-curve and compounding of skills are other familiar terms. Malcom
            Gladwell in his book on exceptional people, Outlier, speaks about the 10,000 hour (thumb) rule.

            How is it that we have become wired to immediate gratification though? Why do we feel the urge to cash out
            and enjoy in the moment than let it accrue into an enormous corpus?
            This desire for immediate rewards isn’t just psychological—it extends to how we approach money, careers, and
            even relationships. It is often attributed to dopamine rush caused by instant and easy access - an age of
            abundance. An interesting and prominent study on this is: the Marshmallow experiment. A group of researchers
            tried (successfully) to establish correlation between a child’s ability to wait 15 minutes for 2 candies
            instead of getting 1 immediately as an estimator of future success in any pursuit. I refute this result
            vehemently, because patience can be cultivated with deliberate practice. Nevertheless, the ability of even a
            small portion of children to think long term at a tender age is commendable.

            I try to imagine my whole (meaningful) career which will span (on average) 40 years as a TV series with 40
            seasons. While being able to stick to even your favorite series for 7 seasons requires being in absolute
            love with it, imagine what 40 would feel like! While this perspective has allowed me to sweat less on the
            small stuff, it still remains incredibly hard to visualize or plan in advance for even the 5th season while
            being in the first. Even if the plan goes through, to hold ground and pivot appropriately is equally
            challenging. There are several reasons why.

            Let’s understand this through SIPs. While 2 decades ago, it was a novel instrument and underutilized,
            post-COVID markets in India have seen influx of household savings into mutual funds. Every second influencer
            baits the average investor with this calculation: that even 20k INR stepped up at 10% across 20 years at
            average (12%) returns will result in wealth north of 4cr (~450k USD). There are two flaws with this
            calculation: first, post tax real returns hover around 6-7% optimistically and second, being patient for 20
            years which is sold as an easy ingredient is actually really hard.
            Our generation wants obscene money, now. Or by end of this year. Shortcuts are en vogue not because people
            don’t want to wait, but because they are inundated by FOMO.

        <blockquote>Warren Buffet famously said: “No one wants to get rich slowly.”</blockquote>

        <p>Social media is largely to blame for this attitude. On the one hand 21-22 year old college dropouts flaunt
            their 400 foot yachts while on the other there are those who popularize self-deprecating humor. We are
            compelled to compare a carefully manicured highlight reel of the best moments of someone’s life with the
            ugly parts of ours: the traffic, toxic workplaces and stifling routines. Frustration is inevitable.
            Shunning social media might sound like a cool, stoic solution of running away but the desire to stay
            connected is too overpowering and human. The humdrum of daily life can be scrolled off one would argue. This
            is one option.</p>

        <p>
            Another choice is to run away from the game. This is fashionable in many western countries and especially
            popular in Europe. Some governments run heavy fiscal deficits and offer subsidized healthcare and lavish
            unemployment allowances and in doing so, any meaningful incentive for the youth to work has been removed. A
            powerful passport, borderless travel and in general, less societal pressure has given way to travel as a
            refuge. People ’live in the moment’ and propagate this way of life. Surely there isn’t an infinite runway
            for any common citizen and consequently, most of them are clueless about pursuing something fulltime.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yet another category of people are those who ‘go with the flow’. These people live life from one day to
            another, usually overwhelmed with the present. Does this count as ‘living in the moment’ as well? It is easy
            to find yourself here, because most people do. This is the classic NPC trap - ones who don’t take risks or
            are never able to think independently. What a stifling, moribund way to live. This is what Thoreau calls a
            ‘live of quiet desperation‘.

            Clearly, this syndrome warrants a much nuanced analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
            To identify and learn these causal-effect relationships required some analysis on my part. But the concrete
            question is: so *how* does one optimize for the long term? Think in decades yet be able to act is days and
            weeks. How to not get strayed by the latest in a ceaseless line of trends, especially in a world around you
            where (most) people succumb?
            For those who already extremely hard, with a sense on urgency, how to set your eyes beyond the next job

            Here are some practical frameworks I (try to) implement:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Spending more time on important decisions: Going to the same club half heartedly and getting hammered,
                reeling with hangover the next day or boasting about lack of it. Saying no is hard, but indecision is
                worse. I use a simple rule: If it’s not a hell yes, it’s a no. No backtracking, no regrets— just
                clarity. It helps sieve a lot of daily bs. The best part is that we forget sooner than we realize. What
                did you do on new year’s eve of 2023? What did you have for dinner last Sunday?
            </li>

            <li>
                Tarantino method (bird’s eye view): We spend too much time in a job we despise or lukewarm
                relationships. We think little about the consequences of entering them, despite the huge chunk of time
                these things absorb. Tarantino’s method is a fancy way of taking one entire day off and thinking about
                all the rights, wrongs, could, should, would in your life. Writing it down. Addressing the elephant in
                the room. Then form a plan on how to move towards your goal and periodically evaluating progress. I do
                this exercise once a month. This allows ruthless prioritization.
            </li>

            <li>
                Sense of urgency (worm’s view): After a broad goal is ready, how can I work in the best possible way to
                reach my goal without burning out? This involves framing daily routines and habits which will permit you
                to put in the hours. Here you can afford to lose sense of time while working. Days blur into one another
                and that is a part and parcel. Its perfectly to fine take a day off every week.
            </li>

            <li>
                Gradual ascent: Then there is the acceptance that I will suck every time I try a new thing. Mastery
                cannot be feigned, it must be earned. When you start out, things are ugly and suboptimal and its fine.
                “It does get easier with every passing day, you just have to do it everyday”, is a line from Bojack
                Horseman that struck with me.
                We can have almost everything we want - just not at the same time. There will be tradeoffs, but in a
                long enough duration all can be achieved: an impactful career, family time, good physique and cultural
                literacy. Dividing life into seasons can be useful.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <blockquote>When there is a war going on, even if you are the best warrior — the battlefield always looks ugly.
        </blockquote>


        <p>
            Each method is obviously more nuanced. For instance, the ‘hell yes or no’ is meant for events with
            predictable outcomes. If something new interests me, I go and adjust my schedule accordingly. Pointless
            second dates or night at the club getting getting shitfaced - have rather predictable outcomes.

            As someone in my 20s, these frameworks are extremely hard to start with and implement consistently. The most
            mundane of things troubles you and adulting is hard. “Everyone can do great work, problem is in the right
            state to do it.” To achieve that state, these above frameworks have proven to be very useful. Long term
            thinking isn’t suffering for a future payoff, rather a sincere attempt to build something meaningful. And
            every now and then, it’s worth stepping back to enjoy the view.
