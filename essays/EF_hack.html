        <h1>EF hackathon</h1>
        <h2>11 March, 2025</h2>


        <p>The allure of starting up is stronger than ever these days. Often, people say it quite casually, 
            as if it were a walk in the garden — almost certain of creating the next unicorn. But in general,  
            this desire to start-up stems in me from a narrative that ones 20s are for taking bold risks and being 
            ambitious, since life imposes more constraints as one gets older. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to experience a simulation of this and the EF hackathon offered the perfect environment. 
            The hackathon is a part of the selection procedure to their annual cohort where they provide a space 
            to work, investors to chat with, leverage their connections to validate problems and potentially build
             a startup and raise money. This hackathon was different than most I had attended previously, because 
             here the emphasis was not mainly on shipping a *github repository* but rather on ruthless ideation 
             using certain frameworks to actually ascertain the scope for starting a business. 

            Let me talk about the structure of the event first and then some learnings. 
            It was a 2 day event from friday to sunday end of day with almost 50 people with very diverse backgrounds 
            - ex-founders, HFT traders, final year students or some with 6-7 years of work experience. 
            Most had software backgrounds too. The agenda was such:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Friday: Introduction of participants, round table dinner with discussions on random topics as ice breaker
            </li>
            <li>
                Saturday: Informal networking, intro about EF, *edge* framework, *hair on fire* nature of a problem,  
                ideation - validation - iteration steps, pre-matched 1-to-1’s and finally hackathon began around 2pm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sunday: submission at 2pm, demos, fireside chat, after-party ;)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            While I dread glib networking, the people turned out to be quite interested in sharing concrete 
            information about their work, areas of interest and competencies. 
        </p>
        <p>

            My team was one of the only two which had chosen to build a non-AI native product/ software. 
            Our backgrounds were in manufacturing, robots, AI and software development.
             The first idea was using AI for quality control of lab grown diamonds. 
             The process was quite simple. Given our collective *edge*, it made sense to gravitate towards 
             AI in manufacturing industry. Next, we checked exports and fastest growing sectors and voilà. 
             We framed our initial hypotheses and scrambled for contacts of diamond traders and equipment vendors 
             through indiamart, family friends, relatives and some Gujrati folks at the event itself. 
             It took us a few hours but we concluded that most customers we just *fine* with the present 
             state of things and the creation of lab grown diamonds posed more of a supply side constraints 
             (1 diamond/ machine per day). 
        </p>

        <p>
            We abolished the old idea and performed a SWOT analysis of the team. After some deliberation, we settled on 
            ‘AI based solution for acceleration of RCA in robotic system breakdowns’. This was an issue that some team members 
            had personally faced. Debugging in robotic systems given the software and hardware harmony is often hard, 
            and especially if the robot is on field long downtimes are a pain. The present system was broken and often 
            informal in indian robotic companies which are mostly in nascent stage, still trying to perfect their product. 
            Breakdown resolution happens over slack channels and takes skill on part of the technician and developers, 
            leading to delays up to 2 days. These concerns were echoed by people working in such firms, 
            which served as crucial validation. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We decided to shape our product as a ticketing system cum RCA tool, which would collect breakdown data 
            over a few months and then begin to make quick predictions about the root cause of the field failure.
             While my team members had deep technical knowledges on the type of issues, I donned the hat of a 
             product manager/ sales guy trying to pose pointed questions and ensure that it turned into a product 
             companies would *actually pay* for. It was fun. I could see the years to reading newspapers, the economist 
             and philosophy materialize through the questions I was asking to define the product better. By the end, 
             we had submitted a demo on an overfitted example using gemini. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The demos came next. Most groups, 12 out of 15 to be precise had created run of the mill AI agents - 
            to analyze financial statements, voice agents for sales, customer sentiment analysis etc. Couple of 
            products that stood out were: AI tool for quick deployment of local ML models (without setting up dependencies, 
            configuring server, sandbox, docker etc) and an AI tool to edit videos based on prompts and emotions. 
            Ours was the only one to have any hardware component to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            What would be my few most important reflections?
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bet on people, rather than staying fixated on the exact problem to work on, which anyways evolves. 
                The brilliant on paper idea falls apart rapidly most of the times.
            </li>

            <li>
                Agents clearly dominated the show. If you automate things and find takers for it, funding is 
                inevitable even though the actual problem is not technically hard or impressive. 
                Ex: AI agent to analyze financial statements or B2C sales.
            </li>

            <li>
                Ruthless tearing apart of your idea is important to develop a product, instead of a 
                1000 lines of *code* without much market appeal.
            </li>

            <li>
                Ideate, validate or dismantle and iterate quickly. Connections are important. So is a good team to work with. 
                Find your ‘edges’ (network, domain skills, insights/ knowledge).
            </li>
            <li>
                The effect of reading newspapers, economist, critical thinking and writing accrues and it *showed* that I had much clearer thinking and frameworks than most people there. 
                If I have equally good technical skills, I could become an invaluable co-founder.
            </li>
            <li>
                I felt like I lost elements of my personality outside of the *story* I had created for myself, like poems, 
                french, working out or loving a slow life. I stammered while speaking french and the thought of looking at loolapalooza stories on instagram was repulsive. As if, all these things which I had filled my life with didn’t matter because of my undivided attention on my work. 
                One could argue this was fruit of the short and intense nature of the hackathon
