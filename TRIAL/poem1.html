            Roses are red,  
            Violets are blue,  
            The sky feels endless,  
            Just like you.  
        </div>

        <div class="poem">
            What can i hold you with?
            I can offer you the loneliness 
            of a man who has long looked at the moon
            I can bribe you with 
            fear, defeat and dspair. 
        </div>
