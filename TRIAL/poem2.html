            Sorrow, I filled the tub with rusty wineand drowned our children in it.
            There are so many gods—

            Fortune, Doorways, Useful Arts—to disappoint them all is fatal.
            I held a world between my teeth once.

            Blue marble, fine china.But nothing makes me happy.

            A million lambent oysters, orgiastic
            pearls of caviar, do not make me happy.

            I have lost my appetite for spring.

            In three days’ time, a swanwill swagger from the bathroom.

            I’ll hate him: all lacquer beak, all bluster.

            You were thinking so loud, he’ll say,and I had a big morning.

            It’s Easter.He’ll wrap his neck around my knee.

            As if he were the epiphyte. As if I were just branches.

            And if I were to leave him, drink seltzer

            on the sofa, fuck someone slowly in the afternoon, watch the daylight stammer.
