            against the wall, the firing squad ready.
            then he got a reprieve.
            suppose they had shot Dostoevsky?
            before he wrote all that?
            I suppose it wouldn't have
            mattered
            not directly.
            there are billions of people who have
            never read him and never
            will.
            but as a young man I know that he
            got me through the factories,
            past the ******,
            lifted me high through the night
            and put me down
            in a better
            place.
            even while in the bar
            drinking with the other
            derelicts,
            I was glad they gave Dostoevsky a
            reprieve,
            it gave me one,
            allowed me to look directly at those
            rancid faces
            in my world,
            death pointing its finger,
            I held fast,
            an immaculate drunk
            sharing the stinking dark with
            my
            brothers.
