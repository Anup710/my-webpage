        If you’re going to try, go all the way.<br>

        Otherwise, don’t even start.If you’re going to try, go all the way.

        Otherwise, don’t even start.

        If you're going to try, go all the way.

        This could mean losing 
        
        girlfriends, 
        
        wives, 
        
        relatives, 
        
        jobs and 
        
        maybe even your mind.

        It could mean not eating for three or four days.

        It could mean freezing on a park bench.

        It could mean jail.

        It could mean derision, mockery, isolation.
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

        Isolation is the gift.
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

        All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it.

        And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.

        And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

        If you’re going to try, go all the way.

        There is no other feeling like that.

        You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire.
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

        DO IT. 
        
        DO IT. 
        
        DO IT. 
        
        All the way.

        You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. 
        
        It’s the only good fight there is.
