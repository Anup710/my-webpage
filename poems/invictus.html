    <!-- <h3>I</h3><br> -->
    <pre class="reduced-line-spacing">
    Out of the night that covers me, <br>
    Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
    I thank whatever gods may be<br>
    For my unconquerable soul.<br>

    In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
    I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
    Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
    My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>

    Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
    Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
    And yet the menace of the years<br>
    Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br>

    It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
    How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
    I am the master of my fate,<br>
    I am the captain of my soul.   <br> 

                        - William Ernest Henley
