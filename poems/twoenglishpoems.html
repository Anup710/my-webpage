    The useless dawn finds me in a deserted street-<br>
    corner; I have outlived the night.<br>
    Nights are proud waves; darkblue topheavy waves<br>
    laden with all the hues of deep spoil, laden with<br>
    things unlikely and desirable.<br>
    Nights have a habit of mysterious gifts and refusals,<br>
    of things half given away, half withheld,<br>
    of joys with a dark hemisphere. Nights act<br>
    that way, I tell you.<br>
    The surge, that night, left me the customary shreds<br>
    and odd ends: some hated friends to chat<br>
    with, music for dreams, and the smoking of<br>
    bitter ashes. The things my hungry heart<br>
    has no use for.<br>
    The big wave brought you.<br>
    Words, any words, your laughter; and you so lazily<br>
    and incessantly beautiful. We talked and you<br>
    have forgotten the words.<br>
    The shattering dawn finds me in a deserted street<br>
    of my city.<br>
    Your profile turned away, the sounds that go to<br>
    make your name, the lilt of your laughter:<br>
    these are the illustrious toys you have left me.<br>
    I turn them over in the dawn, I lose them, I find<br>
    them; I tell them to the few stray dogs and<br>
    to the few stray stars of the dawn.<br>
    Your dark rich life ...<br>
    I must get at you, somehow; I put away those<br>
    illustrious toys you have left me, I want your<br>
    hidden look, your real smile -- that lonely,<br>
    mocking smile your cool mirror knows.<br>

    </h3><br>

    What can I hold you with?<br>
    I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets, the<br>
    moon of the jagged suburbs.<br>
    I offer you the bitterness of a man who has looked<br>
    long and long at the lonely moon.<br>
    I offer you my ancestors, my dead men, the ghosts<br>
    that living men have honoured in bronze:<br>
    my father's father killed in the frontier of<br>
    Buenos Aires, two bullets through his lungs,<br>
    bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers in<br>
    the hide of a cow; my mother's grandfather<br>
    --just twentyfour-- heading a charge of<br>
    three hundred men in Peru, now ghosts on<br>
    vanished horses.<br>
    I offer you whatever insight my books may hold,<br>
    whatever manliness or humour my life.<br>
    I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never<br>
    been loyal.<br>
    I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved,<br>
    somehow --the central heart that deals not<br>
    in words, traffics not with dreams, and is<br>
    untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.<br>
    I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at<br>
    sunset, years before you were born.<br>
    I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about<br>
    yourself, authentic and surprising news of<br>
    yourself.<br>
    I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the<br>
    hunger of my heart; I am trying to bribe you<br>
    with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.<br>
