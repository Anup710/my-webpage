        <div class="poem">

            Into my heart an air that kills
            From yon far country blows:
            What are those blue remembered hills,
            What spires, what farms are those?

            That is the land of lost content,
            I see it shining plain,
            The happy highways where I went
            And cannot come again.

        <blockquote>
            The speaker views a distant land and recalls, with a certain melancholy nostalgia,
            the hills and spires of his homeland. He recognises that, whilst he was happy when
            he lived there, he cannot return there now he is older and has left that land behind.
