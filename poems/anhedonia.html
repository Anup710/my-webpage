        <div class="poem">            
            Sorrow, I filled the tub with rusty wine and drowned our children in it.
            There are so many gods—
            Fortune, Doorways, Useful Arts — to disappoint them all is fatal.
            I held a world between my teeth once.            
            Blue marble, fine china. But nothing makes me happy.            
            A million lambent oysters, orgiastic
            pearls of caviar, do not make me happy.            
            I have lost my appetite for spring.            
            In three days’ time, a swan will swagger from the bathroom.            
            I’ll hate him: all lacquer beak, all bluster.            
            You were thinking so loud, he’ll say,and I had a big morning.             
            It’s Easter. He’ll wrap his neck around my knee.            
            As if he were the epiphyte. As if I were just branches.            
            And if I were to leave him, drink seltzer            
            on the sofa, fuck someone slowly in the afternoon, watch the daylight stammer.
