        against the wall, the firing squad ready.<br>
        then he got a reprieve.<br>
        suppose they had shot Dostoevsky?<br>
        before he wrote all that?<br>
        I suppose it wouldn't have<br>
        mattered.<br>
        not directly.<br>
        there are billions of people who have<br>
        never read him and never<br>
        will.<br>
        but as a young man I know that he<br>
        got me through the factories,<br>
        past the ******,<br>
        lifted me high through the night<br>
        and put me down<br>
        in a better<br>
        place.<br>
        even while in the bar<br>
        drinking with the other<br>
        derelicts,<br>
        I was glad they gave Dostoevsky a<br>
        reprieve,<br>
        it gave me one,<br>
        allowed me to look directly at those<br>
        rancid faces<br>
        in my world,<br>
        death pointing its finger,<br>
        I held fast,<br>
        an immaculate drunk<br>
        sharing the stinking dark with<br>
        my<br>
        brothers.<br>
