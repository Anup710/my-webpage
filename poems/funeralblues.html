    <h2>Funeral Blues</h2><br>
    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

    <!-- <h3>I</h3><br> -->
    <pre class="reduced-line-spacing">

    Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br>
    Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br>
    Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br>
    Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.<br>
    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
    Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br>
    Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.<br>
    Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,<br>
    Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.<br>
    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
    He was my North, my South, my East and West,<br>
    My working week and my Sunday rest,<br>
    My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;<br>
    I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.<br>
    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
    The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,<br>
    Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,<br>
    Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;<br>
    For nothing now can ever come to any good.<br>
