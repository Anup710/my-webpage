    <h2>Tonight I can write</h2><br>

    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

    <pre class="reduced-line-spacing">

    Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>

    Write, for example, 'The night is starry and the stars <br>
    are blue and shiver in the distance.'<br>

    The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br>

    Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>
    I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br>

    Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br>
    I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br>

    She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br>
    How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br>

    Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>
    To think that I do not have her. <br>
    To feel that I have lost her.<br>

    To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br>
    And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br>

    What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br>
    The night is starry and she is not with me.<br>

    This is all. In the distance someone is singing. <br>
    In the distance.<br>
    My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br>

    My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br>
    My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br>

    The same night whitening the same trees.<br>
    We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br>

    I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br>
    My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br>

    Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.<br>
    Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br>

    I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br>
    Love is so short, forgetting is so long.<br>

    Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>
    my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br>

    Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br>
    and these the last verses that I write for her.<br>
