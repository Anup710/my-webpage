        <h1>To the w***** who took my poems</h1>
        <h3>Charles Bukowski</h3>

        <div class="poem">
            some say we should keep personal remorse from the
            poem,
            stay abstract, and there is some reason in this,
            but jezus;
            twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons and you have
            my
            paintings too, my best ones; its stifling:
            are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?
            why didn't you take my money? they usually do
            from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.
            next time take my left arm or a fifty
            but not my poems:
            I'm not Shakespeare
            but sometime simply
            there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise;
            there'll always be mony and ****** and drunkards
            down to the last bomb,
            but as God said,
            crossing his legs,
            I see where I have made plenty of poets
            but not so very much
            poetry.
