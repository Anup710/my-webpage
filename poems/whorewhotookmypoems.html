    Some say we should keep personal remorse from the<br>
    poem<br>
    stay abstract and there is some reason in this,<br>
    but jezus; <br>
    twelve poems gone and I don't keep carbons<br>
    and you have<br>
    my paintings too, my best ones; its stifling<br>
    are you trying to crush me out like the rest of them?<br>
    Why didn't you take my money? they usually do<br>
    from the sleeping drunken pants sick in the corner.<br>
    Next time, take my left arms<br>
    or a fify<br>
    but not my poems. <br>
    I'm not Shakesepare <br>
    but sometime simply <br>
    there won't be any more, abstract or otherwise. <br>
    There will always will money and whores and drunkards<br>
    down to the last bomb, <br>
    as God said,<br>
    crossing his legs, <br>
    I see I have made plenty many poets,<br>
    but not so very much <br>
    poetry. <br>
