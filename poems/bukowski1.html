            the women of the past keep
            phoning.
            there was another yesterday
            arrived from out of
            state.
            she wanted to see
            me.
            I told her
            "no."
            
            I don't want to see
            them,
            I won't see them.
            it would be
            awkward
            gruesome and
            useless.
            
            I know some people who can
            watch the same movie
            more than
            once.
            
            not me.
            once I know the
            plot
            once I know the
            ending
            whether it's happy or
            unhappy or
            just plain
            dumb,
            then
            
            for me
            that movie is
            finished
            forever
            and that's why
            I refuse
            to let
            any of my
            old movies play
            over and over again
            for
            years.
