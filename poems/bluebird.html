    There's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
    wants to get out<br>
    but I'm too tough for him,<br>
    I say, stay in there, I'm not going<br>
    to let anybody see you.<br>

    there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
    wants to get out<br>
    but I pour whiskey on him and inhale<br>
    cigarette smoke<br>
    and the whores and the bartenders<br>
    and the grocery clerks<br>
    never know that<br>
    he's<br>
    in there.<br>

    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>

    there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
    wants to get out<br>
    but I'm too tough for him,<br>
    I say,<br>
    stay down, do you want to mess<br>
    me up?<br>
    you want to screw up the works?<br>
    you want to blow my book sales in Europe?<br>

    <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
    
    there's a bluebird in my heart that<br>
    wants to get out<br>
    but I'm too clever, I only let him out<br>
    at night sometimes<br>
    when everybody's asleep.<br>
    I say, I know that you're there,<br>
    so don't be sad.<br>
    then I put him back,<br>
    but he's singing a little<br>
    in there, I haven't quite let him die<br>
    and we sleep together like that<br>
    with our secret pact<br>
    and it's nice enough to<br>
    make a man weep, but <br>
    I don't weep, <br>
    do you?<br>
