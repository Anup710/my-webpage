            Slowly I married her
            Slowly and bitterly married her love
            Married her body
            ….in boredom and joy
            Slowly I came to her
            Slow and restfully came to her bed
            Came to her table
            in hunger and habit
            ….came to be fed
            Slowly I married her
            sanctioned by none
            with nobody’s name
            ….amid general warnings
            ….amid general scorn
            Came to her fragrance
            ….my nostrils wide
            Came to her greed
            ….with seed for a child
            Years in the coming
            and years in retreat
            ….Slowly I married her
            Slowly I kneeled
            And now we are wounded
            ….so deep and so well
            that no one can hurt us
            except Death itself
            ….And all through Death’s dream
            I move with her lips
            The dream is a night
            ….but eternal the kiss
            And slowly I come to her
            …slowly we shed
            the clothes of our doubting
            ….and slowly we wed

            It’s a long way home down Fairfax to the Santa Monica Freeway, a sinister stretch of the Imagination. The twine of her fragrance sparks above me like an old streetcar cable. Dust of L.A. exhausted springtime in the lever of my headlights, lifting her shade from smoke to smoke among the luminous lane markers. And what is this song but a little night Muzak for those who get out too much, who talk to their divorced wives disembodied between the windshield and the following stars in voices of secret intimacy such as they never used in the everlasting regime of parting.
