        Slowly I married her <br>
        Slowly and bitterly married her love<br>
        Married her body<br>
        ….in boredom and joy<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        Slowly I came to her<br>
        Slow and restfully came to her bed<br>
        Came to her table<br>
        in hunger and habit<br>
        ….came to be fed<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        Slowly I married her<br>
        sanctioned by none<br>
        with nobody’s name<br>
        ….amid general warnings<br>
        ….amid general scorn<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        Came to her fragrance<br>
        ….my nostrils wide<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        Came to her greed<br>
        ….with seed for a child<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        Years in the coming<br>
        and years in retreat<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        ….Slowly I married her<br>
        Slowly I kneeled<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        And now we are wounded<br>
        ….so deep and so well<br>
        that no one can hurt us<br>
        except Death itself<br>
        ….And all through Death’s dream<br>
        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
        I move with her lips<br>
        The dream is a night<br>
        ….but eternal the kiss<br>
        And slowly I come to her<br>
        …slowly we shed<br>
        the clothes of our doubting<br>
        ….and slowly we wed<br>    
        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
        
        - Leonard Cohen

    <!-- …..It’s a long way home down Fairfax to the Santa Monica Freeway, a sinister stretch of the Imagination.<br> 
    The twine of her fragrance sparks above me like an old streetcar cable. <br>
    Dust of L.A. exhausted springtime in the lever of my headlights, lifting her shade from smoke to smoke among <br>
    the luminous lane markers. And what is this song but a little night Muzak for those who get out too much, <br>
    who talk to their divorced wives disembodied between the windshield and the following stars <br>
    in voices of secret intimacy such as they never used in the everlasting regime of parting.<br> -->
